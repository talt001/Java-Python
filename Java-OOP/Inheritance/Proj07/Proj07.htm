<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the official web site for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and&nbsp; make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<h2><strong>Typographical Errors</strong></h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.&nbsp;

<h2 align="center">Source Code and Class Files</h2>

<p>You will find a source code file for the driver class for the program 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<p>You will also find compiled class files for my version of the program in that 
same zip file. Run my version of the program side-by-side with your version and 
compare your output with my output to make sure they match before 
submitting your assignment.</p>

<center>
<h2><strong>Java and Media Library Version Requirement</strong></h2>
</center>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the accompanying document 
titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments</strong> and in the syllabus for this course.</p>

<p>Among other things, this assignment involves:
  </p>
<ul>
	<li>Working with an abstract class.
  </li>
	<li>Using a parameterized constructor.
  </li>
	<li>Working with an abstract method.
  </li>
	<li>Using method overriding. </li>
	<li>Using skills learned in previous assignments.</li>
</ul>
		<p>There are no graphic output images required by this program. Therefore, it can be compiled and executed without a requirement to have Ericson's media library on the classpath.

</p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Write a program named Proj07 that uses the class definition contained 
		in the file named Proj07.java to produce the output shown below on the command-line screen.

</p>
		<p>You may define new classes as necessary to cause your program to behave as required, but you may not modify the class definition for the class named 
		Proj07.

</p>
		<p>The output consists of the following five lines of text on the 
		command-line screen. Because the program generates a random data value for testing, the actual values displayed will differ from one run to the next. However, in all cases, the two values must match. </p>
