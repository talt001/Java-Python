<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the official web site for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and&nbsp; make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>
<h2 class="style2">Output Images</h2>
<p>Your output images must match my output images in every respect including 
color, size, etc., and they must be positioned in the upper-left corner of the 
screen Don't forget to display your name in the output 
images as shown.</p>

<center>
<h2><strong>Typographical Errors</strong></h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.&nbsp;

<h2 align="center">Source Code, Class Files, and Image Files</h2>

<p>You will find a source code file for the driver class for the program 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification. </p>
<p>You will also find 
all required image files in that same zip file. Place the image files in
the same folder as the source files for your programs. <strong>Do not specify a mediapath</strong> for the images in your programs.</p>
<p>You will also find compiled class files for my version of the program in that 
same zip file. Run my version of the program side-by-side with your version and 
compare your output image with my output image to make sure they match before 
submitting your assignment.</p>

<center>
<h2><strong>Java and Media Library Version Requirement</strong></h2>
</center>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the accompanying document 
titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments</strong> and in the syllabus for this course.</p>

<p>Among other things, this assignment involves:
 </p>
<ul>
	<li>Using inheritance
 </li>
	<li>Uaing affine transforms
 </li>
	<li>Using method overloading</li>
	<li>Using method overriding</li>
	<li>Using runtime polymorphism </li>
	<li>Using skills learned in previous assignments.</li>
</ul>
		<p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Write a program named Proj06 that uses the driver class definition provided 
		in the file named Proj06.java and Ericson's media library along 
		with the image file named Proj06.jpg to produce the two graphic output images 
		shown below.</p>
		<p>Note that the images will both appear in the same location in the 
		upper-left corner of the screen. You must move the top one in order to 
		see the bottom one. Be sure to display your images in the order shown 
		below. The second required output image covers the first required output 
		image when the two images are first displayed on the screen.</p>
	  <p>Do not allow the size of the image to change when it is rotated.</p>
		<p>You may define new classes as necessary to cause your
program to behave as required, but you may not modify the
class definition provided in the file named Proj06.java.</p>
		<p>In addition to the output images mentioned above, your
program must display your name on the command-line screen.<br>
